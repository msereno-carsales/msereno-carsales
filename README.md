- ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Maria Sereno, a product designer with expertise in design systems, accessibility and data-driven design. I'm also a hobbyist front-end dev, by which I mean I tinker with random pretty-making code on weekends. 
- ðŸš— This account is specifically for my carsales work. I'm currently a senior systems designer on the Torq team. 
- âœ¨ I have a separate personal GitHub, most of which is private. Looking to contribute to more open-source projects sometime in 2024!
